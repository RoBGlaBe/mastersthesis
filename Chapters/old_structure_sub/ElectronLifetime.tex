\label{sec:elifetime}


E-Lifetime Intro

\subsection{Theory}

* Loss of $e^{-}$ due to impurities when drifting. \\
* what are the impurities? \\
* can captured electrons be released again? mention SE \\
* strax: drift time


\subsection{Analysis}

* 2 example runs: good and bad purity in same(!!) plot \\
* overview plot (?) \\
* explain why errors are larger for high purity
