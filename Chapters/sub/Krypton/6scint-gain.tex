On average the energy $ W = \SI{13.7}{\electronvolt} $ is needed for a primary scintillation quantum, photon or electron.
Based on the energy deposited in the interaction a certain number of quanta $ n = n_\gamma + n_\mathrm{e} $ is thus released.
The ratio $ \nicefrac{n_\gamma}{n_\mathrm{e}} $ can varies depending on the drift field strength and energy of the interacting particle.
We can extract the scintillation gains $ g_1 $ (primary) and $ g_2 $ (secondary) using the ratios at different energies by introducing $ n_\mathrm{i} = \nicefrac{\mathrm{cSi}}{g_\mathrm{i}} $ to express

\begin{equation}
    E = W \left( n_\gamma + n_\mathrm{e} \right) = W \left( \frac{\mathrm{cS1}}{g_1} + \frac{\mathrm{cS2}}{g_2} \right)
    \label{eq:energy-correction}
\end{equation}

$ g_1 $ and $ g_2 $ are purely detector dependent quantities that we use to compare detectors to one another.
They measure how many $ PE $ we detect per initial photon or electron, respectively.
In the case of $ g_2 $, the amplification of the proportional scintillation in the gas gap, as well as the associated extraction efficiency is also contained.
In our case, the comparison to the hermetic \gls{tpc}, the single phase \gls{tpc}, as well as large scale \gls{tpc}s like \nton is of interest.
As cS1 and cS2 are corrected relative to the mean or maximum the measured areas or the theoretically expected absolute, the meaning and values of $ g_{1,2} $ do change.
Therefore, it is important to give this reference.
In this work we correct the electron lifetime to the light of the interpolated number of initial electrons.
All other effects we correct relative to the mean of the used areas as this yields a more stable value.

To extract $ g_1 $ and $ g_2 $ from measurements, we reformulate eq.~\ref{eq:doke-fit} with $ \mathit{QY} = \frac{cS2}{E} $ and $ \mathit{LY} = \frac{cS1}{E} $ to

\begin{equation}
    \mathit{QL} = - \mathit{LY} \frac{g_1}{g_2} + \frac{g_2}{W}.
    \label{eq:doke-fit}
\end{equation}

With this we can fit the doke plot shown in fig.~\ref{fig:doke} linearly where $ m = - \nicefrac{g_2}{g_1} $ and $ c = \nicefrac{g_2}{W} $.  % TODO add plot
Although more than one mono energetic calibration source is necessary to use this method, we can use different field configurations to obtain a good measure of the correct scintillation gains.

Another way to determine the correct $ g_1 $ and $ g_2 $ from a single source with one field is to use the same approach on an event basis, rather then on a run basis.
We fit an ellipse contour to the Krypton population in the $ \nicefrac{\mathrm{cS2}}{E} $-$ \nicefrac{\mathrm{cS1}}{E} $ space, fig.~\ref{fig:elipse}.
