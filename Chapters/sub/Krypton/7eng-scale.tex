We showed the correction of position dependent effects in sec.~\ref{ssec:},~\ref{ssec:}.  % TODO ref einf√ºgen
From energy conservation considerations we got the scintillation gains in sec.~\ref{ssec:}.  % TODO ref
With the scintillation gains we can convert cS1 and cS2 to the interaction energy in \textit{eV}.
However, this conversion from $ \mathit{PE} $ is not generally valid.
The Krypton source we use (sec.~\ref{ssec:}) emits an predominantly electrons and also photons, which both interact with the Xenon's shell electrons, what we call \gls{er}. %  TODO ref
In the case of Neutrons and \gls{dm}, a \gls{nr} takes place with a different energy transfer.
A larger amount of energy is transfered to heat, compared to \gls{er}, which we cannot detect and is thus considered \emph{lost}.
