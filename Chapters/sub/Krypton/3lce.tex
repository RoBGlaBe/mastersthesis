% LCE definition
\paragraph{The \gls{lce} is defined as} the probability that a scintillation photon arrives at the photo-cathode of a \gls{pmt}.
This quantity is a function of the photons' initial position x,y, and z inside the \gls{tpc} with a second order dependence being the purity.
For a large number of initial photons, this corresponds to the fraction of all photons arriving at a photocathode over the total number of photons.
The \gls{lce} cannot be measured directly, because of intrinsic \gls{pmt} efficiencies - the \gls{qe} and \gls{ce}.
Therefore, when working with measured data, it is more convenient to work with a quantity including \gls{qe} and \gls{ce}.
To avoid ambiguities we define the \gls{de} as


\begin{equation}
    \mathit{DE}\left(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z}\right) =  \mathit{LCE}\left(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z}\right) \cdot \mathit{QE} \cdot \mathit{CE}
\end{equation}

where \gls{qe} and \gls{ce} vary for different \gls{pmt} models.
They can also vary rather significantly among \glspl{pmt} of the same model due to the fabrication process.

% contributors (not resolvable which contr. contributes how much to lce)
Different effects contribute to the collective quantity \gls{lce}.
The results of these effects on the \gls{lce} are not disjunct.
This means we cannot infer the contributions of a single effect from the measured \gls{lce} or rather \gls{de}.

\emph{Light attenuation} is the loss of photons per unit length traveled in material following an exponential decay.
In \gls{lxe}, the attenuation length $ \lambda_\mathrm{LXe} $ decreases with larger residual $ \mathrm{O}_2 $, $ \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} $ and others.
An attenuation length of $ \lambda_\mathrm{LXe} > \SI{100}{\centi\m} $ has been measured in similar setups~\cite{Baldini05}.
The scattering length in \gls{xebra} is not experimentally determined but expected to be on the order of meters and therefore light attenuation in the liquid becomes negligible compared to losses on surfaces.

\emph{The reflectivity of \gls{ptfe}} surfaces is with around \SI{95}{\%} high for \gls{vuv} light.
The exact value depends on the quality of the surface treatment and no precise value for the dual-phase \gls{tpc} is known.
With special treatment, as done for \oneton, a reflectivity of \SI{99}{\%} can be achieved\cite{?}. % TODO cite resp. paper
Light is typically not only reflected once, but several times increasing the impact of the parameter.


\emph{The mesh's optical opacity} ($ O $) indicates which fraction of the light is lost on the transit through one of the electrode grids.
This value is well approximated by the geometrical coverage of the plane by the grid and thus makes up $ O \approx \SI{5}{\%} $.


\emph{The optical reflectivity at the \gls{lxe} surface} depends on refractive indices of gaseous and liquid Xenon and the incident angle of the light.
Reflected light travels further and thus has the tendency to be absorbed more likely due to, e.g., attenuation and mesh opacity.

\emph{The reflectivity of \gls{pmt} quartz window} reduces the light collected.
With the refraction index of $ n_\mathrm{quartz} = 1.56 $ the amount of light lost is larger in the gas phase than in the liquid phase.
As $ n_\mathrm{\gls{lxe}} \approx n_\mathrm{quartz} $ and $ n_\mathrm{\gls{gxe}} \approx 1 $, more photons are reflected at the quartz-windows of the top \glspl{pmt}, as they are surrounded by \gls{gxe}.


% z-dependence
\paragraph{The \emph{z} dependence} of the \gls{lce} is dominating the overall behavior.
With the meshes and liquid surfaces laying in the $ x\mbox{-}y $ plane, the respective effects have the most impact on the perpendicular $ z $-direction.
Additionally, the \gls{pmt} types, \gls{qe} and \gls{ce}, the surrounding media, and \gls{pmt} area coverage on the top side differ from the bottom side.
This increases disparity and contributes to the $ z $ trend shown in fig.~\ref{fig:ce_vs_z} which shows a linear behavior.

% r-dependence
\paragraph{The \emph{r} dependence} of the \gls{lce} is minor and does not have a clear trend within its errors as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:ce_vs_r}.

% correction of S1-LCE
The correction of the \gls{lce} here means correcting for the position-dependent light losses based on Krypton calibration data as a first step.
Since some light is always lost, the maximal light measured does not equal the initial number of photons.
We thus correct on a relative scale.
The second step is converting to an absolute scale.
% This step is later done using simulation data from the \gls{nest} software~\cite{?}.  % TODO cite

In the first step, we only correct based on the $ z $-position.
The data for $ r $ shows ambiguities, which is thus not corrected.
In fig.~\ref{fig:s1area_vs_z}, we fit the S1 normalized to the mean $ \mathrm{S1_{a,rel}} = \mathrm{S1_a} \cdot \left( \overline{\mathrm{S1_a}} \right)^{-1} $ over $ z $.  % TODO Satz nochmal schreiben!!
Since we are working on a relative scale and due to how we switch to the absolute, it's justified to correct for the mean.
The S1 area (here S1), as well as the parameters from the linear fit, slope $ m_\mathrm{opt} $ and intercept $ c_\mathrm{opt} $, are used to calculate the \gls{cs1}:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{cS1}_\mathrm{a,b} = \frac{ \mathrm{S1} }{ z \cdot m_\mathrm{opt} + c_\mathrm{opt} }
\end{equation}
