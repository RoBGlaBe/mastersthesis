While \gls{elt} is a vertical effect, there are two main effects altering the S2 area in the horizontal plane.
As shown in sec.~\ref{sec:xebra}, the light is produced in the gas gap by proportional scintillation.
Since the region is narrow and close to the top \gls{pmt}s, the \gls{lce} is higher directly under a \gls{pmt} and therefore describes a pattern in the x-y plane as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:lce-xy-sim-alex}.
The interaction depth, however, does not influence the \gls{lce}.
Beside \gls{lce}, the other effect that influences the light measured of an S2 signal are local differences in the scintillation process.
% TODO hier weiter: deformation --> field, auch gas pressure.......

Although, the effect of \gls{lce} can not be distinguished by data from s
