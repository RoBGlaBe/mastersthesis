\section{Primary and Secondary Scintillation Gain}
\label{sec:ScintGain}

g1, g2 Intro \\
* scint gain is a detector dependent quantity \\
* usefull to compare TPCs

\subsection{Theory}

* with MC data from NEST get nr of electrons in kr interaction \\
* and other aprile plot \\
* calc electron amp gain

* prim/sec sint gain (g1, g2) is the number of detected photons per prim/sec quanta \\
* photons / electrons \\

* g2 thus needs nr electrons in an event \\
* can determine that with e-amp gain \\
* no SE $\Rightarrow$ not directly measureable \\
* with mc data (NEST) and aprile plot (XENON100 SE paper) we ARE able


\subsection{Analysis}

* mc results \\
* aprile plot \\
* e amp gain calc \\
* ... \\
* doke plot \\
* extract g1 g2
