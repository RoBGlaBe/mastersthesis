\label{sec:LCE}


LCE Intro \\
* Not all the light that is produced in a certain spot is seen by the PMTs \\
* position dependent effect \\
* have to correct for that

* differences between S1- \& S2-LCE \\
* list and explain all contributors to LCE

\subsection{Analysis}
(separate top and bot PMT only if its necessary for other analysis in this work, so prob not)
~\\

* Announce MC comparison to Alex's thesis \\
* Measurements and Fit S1 \\
* neglect r-dependence in S1 \\
* Pattern in S2. const in time? \\
* typical AFT \\
* data drive corr. possible? \\
* MC comparison
