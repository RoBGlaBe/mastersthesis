Corr Maps Intro

S1, S2, total, topPMTs, botPMT, energy resolution


* understanding of tpc has to be applied for science run \\
* sum up all corrections in map \\
* store map \\
* strax calcs results cS1, cS2, etc when loading data

\subsection{Theory}

* from g1, g2 to energy scale \\
* combined energy scale \\
* energy resolution \\
* best calibration = best energy resolution


\subsection{Analysis}

* calc energy \\
* plot s1-, s2- and combined energy \\
* energy resolution \\
* background measurement... maybe we can see peaks that we can identify isotopes with
