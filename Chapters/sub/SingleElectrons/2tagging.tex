We discuss our data selection cuts and \gls{se} selection here.
Further reference to our \gls{se} population will be based on the selection discussed here.

\paragraph{After S2 Selection:} Most \gls{se} signals are expected within one drift length after a large S2 peak.
We therefore first select larger S2 peaks and select every peak within one drift length after such an S2.
In case another large S2 peak comes before that drift length window closes we do not select the S2 peak, but open a new window of the length of one drift length.

\paragraph{Two Channels Cut:} We also demand that at least two \gls{pmt}s contribute to the peak.
A peak from just one \gls{pmt} is very likely to stem from a dark count or noise.

\paragraph{\gls{aft} cut:} As S2 photons are produced in a narrow z-range close to the top \gls{pmt}s, they have one probability to be detected by the top rather than the bottom \gls{pmt}.
The result is a S2 specific \gls{aft}, $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{S2} $.
We can see in fig.~\ref{fig:se-aft} that here $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{S2} \approx 0.35 $.  % TODO: plot machen mit a+b/sqrt(area) und flat cuts: aft vs area
However, the lower the signal the more statistical fluctuation we have.
In the \gls{se} region we therefore have a wide spread of \gls{aft}s.
Cutting on the contours given by $ a + \nicefrac{b}{\sqrt{\mathit{area}}} $ does not improve our \gls{se} population significantly, but would rather help with larger S2s.
We get better results with a flat \gls{aft} cut $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{min} = 0.05 $ and $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{max} = 0.95 $ cutting bigger population clearly not belonging to \gls{se}s.

TODO AB HIER INS G2 KAPITEL?
The area histogram up to \SI{100}{\mathit{PE}} with all the previous cuts applied fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist} shows one broader population at just above \SI{20}{\mathit{PE}} with a long tail.
We identify this as our \gls{se} population where we find simultaneous occurrences of multiple electrons in the tail.
Another slightly overlapping population at areas smaller than \SI{10}{\mathit{PE}} is background.
Before fitting the population to extract the mean as the \emph{amplification gain} $ g_\mathrm{SE} $ we want to make sure that the background population does not influence the result of the fit.
We can check this by reducing the background and compare the fit results.
A stable value hints towards low impact of the population on the fit.

We choose the representative groups background, \gls{se}s and tail based on areas.
The representative regions are indicated in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist} by the different background colors spanning from \numrange{0}{7} (background, green), \numrange{15}{30} (\gls{se}, red) and \numrange{40}{100}$ \,\mathit{PE} $ (tail, orange).
Furthermore, we compare the representatives in other dimensions to each other to find one where the background's is well separable from the other two.
The peak length, risetime and number of hits and a combination of these are possible dimensions for the cut.
The respective histograms and cuts are shown in fig.~\ref{fig:len-cut-se},~\ref{fig:len-cut-se},~\ref{fig:len-cut-se}.
We fit all the resulting populations in an area histogram with % the model $ f_\mathrm{SE}\left( \ar \right) $


    % f_\mathrm{SE}\left( \ar \right) =
\begin{align}
    &\sum_{n} G \left(  \ar; n \cdot g_\mathrm{SE}, \sqrt{n} \cdot \sigma_\mathrm{SE}, A_n \right) +
    G_\mathrm{bg} \left( \ar;  \mu_\mathrm{bg}, \sigma_\mathrm{bg}, A_\mathrm{bg} \right) \\
    &\mathrm{where~} G \left( x;  \mu, \sigma, A \right) = A \cdot \exp{ \frac{-\left( x - \mu \right)^2}{2\cdot\sigma^2}}
    \label{eq:se-fit-model}
\end{align}


is a Gaussian function, for n from \numrange{1}{4}.
The parameter estimates of $ g_\mathrm{SE} $ by the fits in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-fits} are hardly influenced by the different background cuts.
As the parameter is stable we intend to reduce the background as much as possible for other analyses.
Our background cut hence is XXX.  % TODO cut value einf√ºgen
We use the other results to estimate the systematic uncertainties.
The resulting fit parameter value is $ g_\mathrm{SE} = X \pm X_\mathrm{stat} \pm X_\mathrm{sys} $.  % TODO add value of g_{se}


With the same approach we also investigate runs with different $ E_\mathrm{amp} $.
We compare the behaviour to the one of \oneton in fig.~\ref{fig:seg-vs-field}.
Although the curves are parallel, we note a systematically worse light response of \xebra.
This can be explained by the different \gls{pmt} model of the top \gls{pmt} array with higher \gls{qe} and \gls{ce} in \oneton.
Also, large efforts have been invested in \oneton to achieve high light yields, that are not feasible for \xebra\footnote{am besten irgendwie anders verpacken?}.
We can overcome these differences by comparing the signal seen by the bottom \gls{pmt}s, since we use the same \gls{pmt} model there and effectively go against light loss due to the shorter \gls{tpc}.
With $ g_\mathrm{SE, bot} = XX $ at $ E_\mathrm{amp} = \left( XX \pm XX \right) \SI{}{\kilo\volt\per\centi\meter} $ we are comparable to \oneton within XXXX.  % TODO fill in blanks

Another issue we are facing lies in an earlier processing step of peaks.
In the waveform example in fig.~\ref{fig:waveforms-se} we on the one hand note a frequent occurence of samples with negative values and on the other hand a waveform that has seemingly arbitrarily split into two peaks.
While the first issue is responsible for a underestimate of nearly all peaks, the second can split up one \gls{se} with full area into two which then share the total area of one physical \gls{se}.
Both effects reduce and underestimate the physical $ g_\mathrm{se} $.
