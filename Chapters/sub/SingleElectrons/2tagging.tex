We discuss our data selection cuts and \gls{se} selection here.  Further reference to our \gls{se} population will be based on the selection discussed here.

\paragraph{After S2 selection:} Most \gls{se} signals are expected within one drift length after a large S2 peak.
We therefore first select larger S2 peaks and select every peak that comes within one drift length after such an S2.
In case another large S2 peak comes before that drift length window closes we do not select the S2 peak, but reopen a new window of the length of one drift length.

\paragraph{Two Channels Cut:} We also demand that at least two \gls{pmt}s contribute to the peak.
A peak from just one \gls{pmt} is very likely to be a dark count or noise.

\paragraph{\gls{aft} cut:} As S2 photons are produced in a narrow z-range close to the top \gls{pmt}s, they have one probability to be detected by the top rather than the bottom \gls{pmt}.
The result is a S2 specific \gls{aft}, $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{S2} $.
We can see in fig.~\ref{fig:se-aft} that here $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{S2} \approx 0.35 $.  % TODO: plot machen mit a+b/sqrt(area) und flat cuts: aft vs area
However, the lower the signal the more statistical fluctuation we have.
In the SE region we therefore have a wide spread of \gls{aft}s.
Cutting on the contours given by $ a + \nicefrac{b}{\sqrt{\mathit{area}}} $ does not improve our \gls{se} population significantly, but would help with larger S2s.
We get better results with a flat \gls{aft} cut $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{min} = 0.05 $ and $ \mathit{AFT}_\mathrm{max} = 0.95 $ cutting bigger population clearly not belonging to \gls{se}s.

The area histogram up to \SI{100}{\mathit{PE}} with all the previous cuts applied fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist} shows one broader population at just above \SI{20}{\mathit{PE}} with a long tail.
We identify this as our \gls{se} population where in the tail we have occurrences of multiple electrons simultaneously.
Another slightly overlapping population at areas smaller than \SI{10}{\mathit{PE}} is background.
Before fitting the population to extract the mean as the \emph{amplification gain} we want to make sure that the background population does not influence the result of the fit.
We can check this by reducing the background and compare the fit results.
A stable value hints towards low impact of the population on the fit.

We choose the representative groups background, \gls{se}s and tail based on areas.
The representative regions are indicated in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist} by the different background colors spanning from \numrange{0}{7} (background, green), \numrange{15}{30} (\gls{se}, red) and \numrange{40}{100}$ \,\mathit{PE} $ (tail, orange).
Furthermore, we compare the representatives in other dimensions to each other to find one where the background's is well separable from the other two.
The peak length, risetime and number of hits and a combination of these are possible dimensions for the cut.
The respective histograms and cuts are shown in fig.~\ref{fig:len-cut-se},~\ref{fig:len-cut-se},~\ref{fig:len-cut-se}.
We fit all the resulting populations in an area histogram with % the model $ f_\mathrm{SE}\left( \ar \right) $


    % f_\mathrm{SE}\left( \ar \right) =
\begin{align}
    &\sum_{n} G \left(  \ar; n \cdot g_\mathrm{SE}, \sqrt{n} \cdot \sigma_\mathrm{SE}, A_n \right) +
    G_\mathrm{bg} \left( \ar;  \mu_\mathrm{bg}, \sigma_\mathrm{bg}, A_\mathrm{bg} \right) \\
    &\mathrm{where~} G \left( x;  \mu, \sigma, A \right) = A \cdot \exp{ \frac{-\left( x - \mu \right)^2}{2\cdot\sigma^2}}
    \label{eq:se-fit-model}
\end{align}


is a Gaussian function, for n from \numrange{1}{4}.
The fits in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-fits} all yield $ g_\mathrm{SE} $ that are compatible within their uncertainties.
