\subsection{Intrinsic Width of Single Electrons}
\label{ssec:width}
\FloatBarrier


As discussed in sec.~\ref{ssec:se-source}, the peak width of \glspl{se} is very sensitive to the size of the gas gap, and therefore the width is a good indicator of deformations of the grid~\cite{?}.
A spacial mapping is not possible due to the lack of a position reconstruction for \glspl{se}.

% S2s usually have $ z $ dependent widths due to longitudinal diffusion.
% The arrival time at the liquid interface of the electrons in one S2 electron clound spreads dependent on the drift time.
Due to longitudinal diffusion, S2 widths depend, among others, on the interaction depht $ z $, or the drift time.
The spread of the electron cloud in \gls{lxe} increases accordingly with $ z $ when arriving at the liquid interface.
For \glspl{se} this is not the case since these are single quanta.
Thus, \glspl{se} tell us the intrinsic width of one electron causing scintillation which can be used to infer the exact time between the first and last electron in the electron cloud.
