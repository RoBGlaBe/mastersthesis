\subsection{Single Electron Rates}
\label{ssec:rate}
\FloatBarrier


We calculate the rate of \glspl{se} by integrating the fit of the histogram in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist}.
We integrate each Gaussian in eq.~\ref{eq:se-fit-model} individually, disregarding the background and weighting the others with $ n $.
In this example run, we find a \gls{se} rate of $ r_\mathrm{SE} = (310\pm30)\,\mathrm{Hz} $.

\glspl{se} or few-electron signals coinciding with S1s or S1 like signals can mimic \gls{dm} or other low energy signals.
An additional investigation of small S1-like signal rates can be conducted to infer a coincidence rate for events these mimic signals.
This investigation is however beyond the scope of this work.
