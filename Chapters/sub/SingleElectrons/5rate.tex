The rate of \gls{se}s can easily be calculated by integrating the fit of the histogram in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist}.
We integrate each gaussian in eq.~\ref{eq:se-fit-model} individually disregarding the background and weighting the others with $ n $.
In this example run we find a \gls{se} rate of XX \SI{}{\hertz}.

\gls{se} coinciding with S1s or S1 like signal can mimic \gls{dm} or other low energy signal.
To estimate the rate of such the respective rate and thus the chance of an coincidence has to be understood.
The estimate of the S1 like signal is not part of this work.
