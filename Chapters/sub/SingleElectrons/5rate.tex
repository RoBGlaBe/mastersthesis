The rate of \glspl{se} can be calculated by integrating the fit of the histogram in fig.~\ref{fig:se-area-hist}.
We integrate each Gaussian in eq.~\ref{eq:se-fit-model} individually, disregarding the background and weighting the others with $ n $.
In this example run we find a \gls{se} rate of XX \SI{}{\hertz}.

\glspl{se} coinciding with S1s or S1 like signals can mimic \gls{dm} or other low energy signal.
To estimate that mimic rate the respective S1-like rate and thus the chance of an coincidence has to be understood.
The estimate of the S1 like signal is not part of this work.
